# Drunk Game

This project comes from the idea of some friends to have an app where can find some games that people are used to playing when they are partying or drinking with friends.

It's made with React Native, using Yarn as package controller and using Expo framework to serve the application.

It uses Redux to store all the necessary information. At the moment it haven't any backend services.
